# 06 Server-Side APIs: Weather Dashboard

## About this project

Third-party APIs allow developers to access their data and functionality by making requests with specific parameters to a URL. Developers are often tasked with retrieving data from another application's API and using it in the context of their own. 

This weather app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS.
